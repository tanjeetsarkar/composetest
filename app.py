    Handling transient errors
    Note the way the get_hit_count function is written. This basic retry loop lets us attempt our request multiple times if the redis service is not available. This is useful at startup while the application comes online, but also makes our application more resilient if the Redis service needs to be restarted anytime during the apps lifetime. In a cluster, this also helps handling momentary connection drops between nodes.
